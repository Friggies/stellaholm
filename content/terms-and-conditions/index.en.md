## General Information

By accessing or using this website, you agree to abide by these Terms and
Conditions. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use this
website or make any purchases.

## Products and Orders

-   **Custom-Made Products**: All custom-made products are final sale and
    **non-returnable**. Due to the personalized nature of these items, they
    cannot be returned or refunded unless they are defective or damaged during
    shipping.
-   **Non-Custom Products**: For non-custom products, we accept returns and
    refunds within 14 days of delivery, provided the items are unused and in
    their original packaging.

## Payment and Processing

-   **Payment Providers**: We use **Stripe** and **Snipcart** to process
    payments. By purchasing on this site, you consent to the sharing of your
    information (such as name, contact details, and payment details) with these
    third parties to facilitate the transaction. Both Stripe and Snipcart are
    responsible for the handling and protection of your payment information.

-   **Order Confirmation**: Once your payment is processed, you will receive an
    email confirmation with your order details.

## Shipping

-   We use **DAO** for shipping. Your personal information necessary for
    shipping (such as name, address, and contact information) will be shared
    with DAO to ensure your order is delivered correctly.

-   We are not responsible for delays in shipping due to third-party carriers.
    However, we will provide tracking information where possible to keep you
    updated.

## Privacy Policy

-   **Data Usage**: We collect and store only the information necessary to
    process your order (name, address, email, payment details, etc.). Your
    information will not be shared with third parties except for payment
    processing (via Stripe and Snipcart) and shipping (via DAO).

-   **Cookies**: This website does **not** collect or store cookies.

## Liability

-   We do our best to ensure the accuracy of product descriptions and images.
    However, slight variations in color, size, or design may occur, especially
    with custom-made products.
-   We are not responsible for any issues related to payment processing or
    shipping delays caused by third-party services (Stripe, Snipcart, DAO).

We reserve the right to update or modify these terms and conditions at any time
without prior notice. Any changes will be posted on this page, and your
