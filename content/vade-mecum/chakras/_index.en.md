Chakras are energy centres in the body that affect both our physical and
spiritual balance. There are seven primary chakras, each representing different
aspects of life, from stability to spiritual freedom.

Our range of handmade jewellery includes designs with genuine chakra stones,
created to support your energy balance and help you feel more centred and
connected.
